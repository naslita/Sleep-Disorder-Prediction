## **‚õ≥ Introduction‚õ≥**

In our busy working lives, we often underestimate the significance of prioritizing a healthy lifestyle. Yet, sleep is undeniably vital for our overall health and wellness. Incorporating elements like a balanced diet, consistent exercise, and stress management can profoundly improve the quality of our sleep, thereby safeguarding our heart health.

### **üìå Problem Statement**

**Sleep Disorder** encompass conditions stemming from unhealthy sleep habits and lifestyles. Neglecting proper sleep can pose significant risks to our health and well-being, as sleep plays a pivotal role in maintaining overall health. Research from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health indicates that between 50 to 70 million American adults grapple with irregular sleep patterns or suffer from disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea, underscoring a prevalent issue in our society.

Drawing from the aforementioned facts, **adhering to a balanced diet**, **maintaining regular exercise**, and **effectively managing stress levels emerge** as pivotal strategies for preventing sleep disorders.

### **üìå Goals**

- Discover factors impacting sleep health and lifestyle for detecting signs of sleep disorders.
- Predict the likelihood of individuals experiencing sleep disorders using their sleep health and lifestyle data.
- Identify and address sleep-related issues, especially in healthcare.
- Obtain the optimal model for predicting sleep disorders. 


### **üìå Objectives**

Develop a classification model to **anticipate the primary factors contributing to sleep disorders**, **facilitating the prompt detection and prevention of such disorders**.

## **üïπ Data Understanding üïπ**

**Sleep Disorder ([link datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data))**


**Dataset Description:**

**Metadata**

- `Personal ID` - An identifier for each individual
- `Gender` - The gender of the person (Male/Female)
- `Age` - The age of the person in years
- `Occupation` - The occupation or profession of the person
- `Sleep Duration (hours)` - The number of hours the person sleeps per day.
- `Quality of Sleep (scale: 1-10)` - A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10
- `Physical Activity Level (minutes/day)` - The number of minutes the person engages in physical activity daily
- `Stress Level (scale: 1-10)` - A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10
- `BMI Category` - The BMI category of the person (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight)
- `Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic)` - The blood pressure measurement of the person, indicated as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure
- `Heart Rate (bpm)` - he resting heart rate of the person in beats per minute.
- `Daily Steps` - The number of steps the person takes per day.
- `Sleep Disorder` - The presence or absence of a sleep disorder in the person (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea)

#### **Statistical Summary**
*Considering the distribution of all numerical variables, they exhibit a positive skew toward the right*

Observation Summary Numerical:
* Overall, the minimum and maximum values make sense for each column
*`Age`, `Sleep Duration`, `Quality of Sleep`, `Physical Activity Level`,`Stress Level`,`Heart Rate` and `Daily Steps` are discrete values with any unique values, need to conclude its simmetricity either.
* Mean != 50% (Median) in `Sleep Duration`, `Quality of Sleep`, `Physical Activity Level`,`Stress Level`,`Heart Rate` and `Daily Steps`column, shows a positive direction distribution

Observation Summary Categorical:
* `Gender` has 2 unique values: 'Male' and 'Female'.
* `Job` has 11 unique values: 'Nurse', 'Doctor', 'Engineer', 'Lawyer', 'Teacher', 'Accountant', 'Salesperson', 'Software Engineer', 'Scientist', 'Sales Representative', and 'Manager'.
* `BMI Category` has 3 unique values: 'Normal', 'Overweight', and 'Obesity'.
* `Blood Pressure` has 25 unique values and the most is 130/85.
* `Sleep Disorders` has 3 unique values: 'None', 'Sleep Apnea', and 'Insomnia'.
* From the categorical data, the following can be observed:
1. While there are more male individuals, the difference compared to females is not very significant, with only a discrepancy of 4 individuals.
2. There are more individuals in nursing jobs, but the difference is not significantly greater than other professions.
3. More individuals fall into the BMI category 'Normal', but the difference is not significantly greater than other BMI categories.
4. More individuals do not have sleep disorders, but the difference is not significantly greater than those who do have sleep disorders.
* In terms of the target variable, `Sleep Disorder = None` (any specific sleep disorder) is more frequent in the dataset. But, the imbalance condition is NOT severe (still OK)
